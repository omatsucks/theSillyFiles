            Once upon a time, in the land of high-flying dreams and average talent, there was a man who called himself YoYoM. Not to be confused with any actual yoyo enthusiasts or professionals, YoYoM was more into tossing around compliments to himself than anything else. His claim to fame? A few mediocre gaming sessions and some lackluster YouTube videos where he proudly boasted, “I’m the best there ever was.”

It wasn’t long before his ego swelled to the size of a hot air balloon. His friends? Gone. The man couldn't walk past a mirror without winking at his reflection and saying, "Looking good, champ." Rumor has it he even tried to convince his neighbor's cat to call him “sir.”
<br>
<br>
The peak of YoYoM’s delusion came when he decided to stream his “legendary” gaming skills. Unfortunately, the reality of the situation hit harder than his FPS skills—30 viewers saw him get bodied in every game he played. Instead of owning up, YoYoM blamed the lag, the weather, the universe, and at one point... the government.
<br>
<br>
Despite his losses, YoYoM’s ego was unshaken. After all, who needs wins when you have that much confidence, right? He even made a celebratory speech on stream after winning a single round of Rocket League, acting like he just won the World Cup.
<br>
<br>
But it wasn’t long before the internet got tired of his act. His viewers disappeared, his Twitch subs plummeted, and YoYoM was left shouting into the void, “They just can’t handle my greatness!”
<br>
<br>
To this day, YoYoM still practices in front of the mirror, narrating his imaginary highlights. But let this be a lesson: no amount of self-love can carry you when your skills are more inflated than your head.

So here's to YoYoM, the man whose ego was larger than his talent.
