            Meet Hayhay, a girl whose love for Rocket League isn’t just a hobby—it’s a full-blown lifestyle. While some people enjoy a casual game every now and then, Hayhay lives, breathes, and possibly even dreams in Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Car mode. If Rocket League had a citizenship test, she’d pass with flying, aerial-dribbling colors.

            more, because the last one didn’t count (curse that lag!). Before long, she was pulling all-nighters, eyes bloodshot, her car boost meter running on nothing but caffeine and stubbornness.

            Her friends tried to intervene, but all their texts went unanswered. Not because she was ignoring them—she just had chat disabled.            <br>
            <br>

                The Training Arc

            <br>
            Like a main character in a sports anime, Hayhay took her training seriously. While normal people spent time outdoors, she was perfecting her flip resets in Freeplay. When other players were stuck in Gold, she was grinding her way to Grand Champion, leaving a trail of tilted opponents and shattered egos in her wake.

            At some point, she stopped walking like a normal human and started dodging and half-flipping through hallways. If you asked her to parallel park in real life, she’d probably try to wave dash into the spot.

            <h3 class="Article">
                Her friends and family noticed the change. Dinners were skipped. Birthdays forgotten. When asked if she wanted to go out, she responded, "Can’t, I have RLCS scrims." (She does not, in fact, play in RLCS.)

                One friend tried to talk some sense into her. "Hayhay, you’re addicted!"
                
                "No, I just love the game!"
                
                "When was the last time you saw sunlight?"
                
                Hayhay had to think long and hard about that one.

           <h2 class="semiheader"> The Intervention </h2><br /> <br />

           <h3 class="Article">
            
            Eventually, her friends staged an intervention. They sat her down, took away her controller, and made her watch videos of people touching grass.

            She stared blankly. "Looks like Forbidden Temple, but with weird lighting."
            
            It was at that moment they knew—it was too late. Hayhay was lost to the car soccer abyss forever.            <br>

                <br>
                Is Hayhay’s obsession unhealthy? Maybe. Will she stop? Absolutely not. She might be sleep-deprived, socially absent, and possibly hallucinating boost pads in real life, but hey—at least she’s peaking.

                Besides, when the ranked grind calls, who are we to judge?
