                It was a calm day in the world of Blox Fruits. The sea was peaceful, the pirates were busy being pirates, and then... there was Mischievous. Now, Mischievous was not your average Blox Fruits player. He was known for causing chaos wherever he went, whether that meant throwing random bombs at enemies (or friends) or screaming in excitement over the smallest things.

                Today, though, something BIG happened.               
                <br>
                <br>
            </h3>
                <h2 class="semiheader">It started with a scroll...                </h2>
            <h3 class="Article">
                <br>
                <br>
                Mischievous had been grinding for hours, hopping from island to island, chopping down NPCs like they were weeds in his backyard. His goal? The fabled Light Fruit. After weeks of suffering with the Flame fruit (which, honestly, was more like a glorified campfire), he needed Light.

                And then it happened. The Blox Fruits gods heard his cries.
                
                Ding! A golden scroll popped up on his screen: "You have found the Light Fruit!"
                
                Mischievous couldn’t believe his eyes. His hands shook. He almost dropped his keyboard. But no, this moment was too precious. He grabbed his headset, jumped into a voice chat, and frantically called his best pal, Ahmad.
                <br>
                <br>
            </h3>
                <h2 class="semiheader">"AHMAD, I GOT LIGHT!"</h2>
            <h3 class="Article">
                <br>
                <br>
                But there was silence.

                Mischievous started typing furiously. His fingers flew over the keyboard like he was in the middle of a professional esports match.
                
                "AHMAD I GOT LIGHT AHMAD AHMAD WHERE ARE YOU DUDE I GOT LIGHT!"
                
                Still no response. Ahmad, as always, was either AFK or napping. But this was no time for naps. This was the moment Mischievous had been waiting for since, like... forever.
                
                Suddenly, Ahmad's calm voice echoed through the voice chat:
                "Bro, what?"
                
                "I GOT LIGHT, AHMAD!" Mischievous yelled, probably loud enough to wake up his entire neighborhood.
                
                "Okay, cool...?"
                
                "NO! NOT COOL! I GOT LIGHT! LIGHT FRUIT, AHMAD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? I'M BASICALLY A GOD NOW!"
                
                Mischievous was already imagining his new life. No more crawling through islands like a peasant. With the Light Fruit, he was about to turn into a golden beam of pure destruction. He could hear the noobs trembling in fear just thinking about it.
                
                But Ahmad wasn’t reacting the way Mischievous wanted him to.
                
                "Dude," Ahmad sighed, "It's just a fruit. Calm down."
                
                "No, Ahmad. YOU calm down. This isn't just a fruit. This is THE fruit. I'm about to zoom across the map faster than you've ever seen. You? You're just gonna be sitting there with your puny Bomb fruit, looking like an off-brand superhero."
                
                Ahmad, trying to keep his cool, replied, "Misch, you've got, like, zero mastery points on that thing. You don’t even know how to use it yet."
                
                But Mischievous was already gone. Not physically, but mentally, he was already the Light King of Blox Fruits. He was about to destroy every enemy, every boss, and maybe even Ahmad himself.
                <br>

                <br>
                This time, Ahmad didn’t even respond. He had accepted his fate. He knew that for the next week (or two, or maybe forever), all he was going to hear was:

                "Ahmad, I got Light."
                "AHMAD, I GOT LIGHT!"
                "Yo, Ahmad, did I tell you? I GOT LIGHT!"
                
                And thus began the legendary tale of Mischievous, the man who got Light – and never stopped talking about it.
