            Meet Warry, a guy with a very unique obsession. No, he’s not into sports, gaming, or even conspiracy theories. Warry’s passion in life is asking one simple question to anyone and everyone: "Are you real?" Some say it’s just a joke. Others fear it’s something more sinister. Either way, if you’ve ever spoken to Warry, you’ve probably had to convince him of your own existence.

            The Beginning of the Madness

            It all started as a harmless quirk. Warry asked a friend once, "Are you real?" They laughed, he laughed, and that should have been the end of it. But Warry discovered something powerful: confusion. Watching people struggle to answer was his new favorite hobby.

            Soon, he was questioning everyone—his family, his coworkers, even the barista at his local coffee shop.
            
            "Sir, here’s your order."
            
            "Thanks… but are you real?"
            
            "What?"
            <br>
            <br>

            His friends tried to adapt. Some ignored him. Others tried to fight back.

            "Warry, shut up. Of course I’m real."
            
            "That’s exactly what an AI would say."
            
            At work, his boss got tired of it. "Warry, did you finish the report?"
            
            "Yes. But before we continue… are you real?"
            
            HR was called.

            <h2 class="semiheader">The Downward Spiral</h2>
            <h3 class="Article">
                Warry’s obsession deepened. He started watching simulation theory documentaries. His Google search history contained phrases like “how to prove reality exists” and “am I trapped in a video game?” His friends stopped inviting him out, fearing the existential crisis that always followed.

                One day, he stubbed his toe. Instead of yelling in pain like a normal person, he gasped and whispered, "Pain… proof of existence…?"
            
            <br>

           <h2 class="semiheader"> The Breaking Point </h2><br /> <br />

           <h3 class="Article">
            
            The final straw came when Warry tried to test reality itself. He ran at full speed into a glass door.

            "Why would you do that?!" his friend screamed.

            Warry groaned from the floor. "Wanted to see if collision physics were enabled."            <br>
            <br>

            <h2 class="semiheader">The Conclusion</h2>  
            <h3 class="Article">
                <br>
                <br>
                Will Warry ever stop asking? Doubtful. Will he ever get an answer that satisfies him? Also doubtful. But one thing is certain—if you ever meet Warry, be prepared for the question.

                And whatever you do, do not hesitate when you answer. Because if you do… Warry will know.
