            <h3 class="Article">
                Once upon a time, Ahmed was a rising star on the internet. His jokes were fire, his memes were golden, and his comebacks were the stuff of legend. But then… something happened. His humor took a hard left turn down the highway of brainrot, and the once-great Ahmed has become a tragic figure—a broken record of repetitive nonsense, spitting out “zyatt, gyatt, zamn zats a zyatt,” and “rizz” like he’s getting paid by the letter. Spoiler: He’s not.

                At first, it was fine. Everyone’s gotta have their catchphrases, right? But Ahmed took it to a whole new level. He didn’t just dip his toes into the world of internet slang—he dove headfirst and got stuck in a whirlpool of "zyatt" and "gyatt" like he was auditioning for the role of the internet's most confusing parrot.

                Remember when Ahmed used to have actual conversations? Neither do we. Now, everything is “gyatt” this, “zyatt” that, like he’s trying to summon a spirit but forgot the actual words. His friends have long stopped trying to decipher the code, resorting to nodding and walking away while Ahmed mutters “rizz” under his breath like a discount magician who can’t pull a rabbit out of a hat.

                <br>
                Once Ahmed learned to say “zamn zats a zyatt,” it became his personal mantra. Every mildly interesting thing? “Zamn zats a zyatt.” A squirrel runs past? “Zamn zats a zyatt.” You get a haircut? “Zamn zats a zyatt.” At this point, Ahmed’s one step away from wandering into Walmart and screaming “zyatt” at the canned goods aisle. He’s become a walking, talking internet meme—and not in the fun way.

                Oh, and let’s talk about the “rizz.” Ahmed’s obsession with “rizz” would be admirable if it weren’t so tragic. He says it like it’s a magic spell that’ll turn him into a charismatic genius. Spoiler alert: it hasn’t. In fact, the more Ahmed talks about having "rizz," the more people slowly inch away, trying not to make eye contact. His “rizz” is like the Wi-Fi at your grandma’s house—weak and nonexistent.

                The internet waits, wondering if Ahmed will ever recover from his self-inflicted brainrot. Maybe one day, he’ll snap out of it and return to being the witty guy who didn’t sound like he was speaking in some strange code that only he understands. Or maybe he’ll just become the poster child for why we need a limit on how much slang one person can use in a single sentence.
                Until then, Ahmed, here’s a tip: maybe it’s time to *rizz* up a new vocabulary.
