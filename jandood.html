            <h3 class="Article">
                Meet Jandood, a guy with a one-track mind and a singular purpose in life: getting Ahmad to play with him. Whether it’s morning, noon, or the middle of a global crisis, you can bet that Jandood is somewhere, typing frantically, saying the words that have become his personal anthem: "Ahmad can you play?"                <br>

                <br>
                It all started innocently. A simple request here, a casual message there. But soon, it became a ritual. No matter what was happening in the world—earthquake, power outage, Ahmad's own grandmother’s birthday—Jandood would emerge from the shadows, asking the all-important question.

                "Ahmad can you play?"
                
                "Bro, I’m at a funeral."
                
                "Ahmad can you play after?"
                                <br>
                <br>

                <h2 class="semiheader">The Relentless Pursuit</h2>
            <h3 class="Article">
                <br>
                <br>
                Jandood’s dedication knows no bounds. Some say he has alarms set every hour to remind him to ask Ahmad. Others believe he has automated bots sending the message when he’s asleep. No one really knows. All we know is that Ahmad never has a moment of peace.

                If Ahmad is online, Jandood is already typing. If Ahmad is offline, Jandood is waiting. If Ahmad blocks him, Jandood is making alt accounts.
                
                At this point, Ahmad’s phone auto-corrects anything he types into “I can’t play, Jandood.” Even when Ahmad does play, Jandood immediately starts planning the next session. The man has no chill.                <br>

                <br>
                But Jandood’s obsessions don’t stop there. No, no, no. When he’s not begging Ahmad to play, he’s fixated on one thing: his legendary Rise of Kingdoms king profile picture. This is not just an image—it is his entire personality.

                Some people post selfies. Some people share pictures of their pets. Jandood? He proudly displays a picture of a digital king, as if he rules over an actual empire (spoiler: he doesn’t). If you ever dare to insult the king, prepare for war. Jandood will launch an essay in your DMs explaining why his in-game kingdom is superior to your entire existence.

            <h3 class="Article">
                <br>
                <br>
                Will Jandood ever stop asking Ahmad to play? No. Will Ahmad ever get a moment of peace? Also no. Will Jandood ever change his profile picture? Not a chance.

                At the end of the day, Jandood is a man of commitment, persistence, and just the right amount of unhealthy obsession. And Ahmad? Well, he might as well change his legal name to Busy, Sorry Jandood at this point.
